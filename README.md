It's flappy bird but with a nerd instead of the bird and instead of the pipes it dodges, the pipes are poopoo. You get a point every time you dodge a piece of poopi. For every ten points you get the sprite of the nerd poops himself and then the poop falls out of screen.


nothing works but I've created the random variables

also two collumns exist but they don't move
